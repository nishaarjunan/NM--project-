# Decoding Emotions through Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Conversations

This project aims to decode user emotions by analyzing social media conversations using sentiment analysis techniques powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning models. It focuses on identifying, classifying, and visualizing emotional tones (positive, negative, neutral) from user-generated content on platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Reddit.

## Project Information

- **Project Title**: Decoding Emotions through Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Conversations
- **Author**: Nisha.A
- **Date**: 10th May 2025

## Features

- Real-time sentiment analysis of social media text
- Emotion classification (positive, negative, neutral)
- Visual analytics dashboard with sentiment trends
- Preprocessing pipeline to clean noisy social media data
- Scalable architecture for large-scale text datasets

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
- TextBlob / VADER Sentiment Analyzer
- Scikit-learn / TensorFlow (for custom classifiers)
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data processing and visualization)

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Scrape or stream tweets/posts using APIs (e.g., Twitter API).
2. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - Remove URLs, mentions, hashtags, emojis, and stopwords.
   - Tokenize and normalize text (lemmatization/stemming).
3. **Sentiment Detection**:
   - Apply pre-trained models (VADER/TextBlob) or train custom classifiers.
4. **Visualization**:
   - Generate graphs for sentiment distribution, word clouds, and trends over time.

## Installation

```bash
pip install nltk textblob matplotlib pandas seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Run `data_collection.py` to collect or simulate social media data.
2. Run `sentiment_analysis.py` to perform sentiment classification.
3. Use `visualize_results.py` to see charts and emotion trends.

## Example Output

- Sentiment Pie Chart
- Word Cloud of Most Frequent Terms
- Line Chart showing sentiment over time
